# land-use-regulation-analysis

Since the 1970s, there has been a substantial increase in real estate prices across the U.S., especially in coastal communities and mountainous areas. There are many factors explaining the rise, but one not explored until recently is the increasing rigidity of municipal land use codes. Parking requirements, height limits, mandatory lot sizes, historic preservation rules, increasing permit review times, and more citizen input in the development process have increased the cost and complexity of developing housing. My analysis shows a moderate relationship between the Wharton Land Use Regulation Index and Zillow Home Value and Rent Indexes.
